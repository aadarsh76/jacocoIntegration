# Explanation:
## Prepare Docker Configuration:

- Backup the existing Docker Compose file: This ensures that you have a backup of the original configuration.
- Update the Docker Compose file: Modify the file to include the JaCoCo agent in the JVM arguments and add a volume mapping to persist the JaCoCo data.
## Restart Docker Services:

- Restart Docker Compose services: Apply the changes made to the Docker Compose configuration by restarting the services.
## Verify JaCoCo Agent:

- Check the presence of the JaCoCo .exec file: Ensure that the JaCoCo agent is running and generating the coverage data file.
This script provides a generic approach to instrument JaCoCo in a Docker container and can be customized based on specific requirements and configurations.
